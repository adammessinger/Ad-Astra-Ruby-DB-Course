##Active Record, Rake, and Migrations

Active Record is an **ORM:** an Object Relational Mapping library. In its own 
words, from its readme: "Active Record connects classes to relational database 
tables to establish an almost zero-configuration persistence layer for 
applications. The library provides a base class that, when subclassed, sets up a 
mapping between the new class and an existing table in the database." To quote the
lesson files: "Instead of dealing directly with your database by writing SQL queries 
and inserts, you can use Active Record's prebuilt functionality." We're going to 
learn how to use it by re-creating the to-do program.

Rake is a tool used to run one-off tasks. Basically, this is Ruby's version of 
`make`. When you run `rake`, it looks in your current directory for a file called 
`Rakefile` (no file extension) where you can define your rake tasks, like setting up 
the database.
